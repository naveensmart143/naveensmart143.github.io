<h1>Data Structures</h1>
<p>A data structure is a way of storing and retrieving data efficiently. There are two main objectives to study data structures. First one is to identify and develop useful entities and operations and decide what type of problems can be solved with these entities and operations. The second one is to decide how to represent those entities and implement operations on those representations.
There are two types of data structures are available to C/C++ programmers. One type of data structures are already built into C/C++ programming languages. These can be Arrays, Structures and classes. Other one is complex data structures that can be implemented using built in data types and structures in C/C++ programming languages. Some of the examples of these data structures are Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree and Graph.
Sometimes built in data structures do not fulfil the requirements and we have to implement our own data structures. All of these complex data structures have their own strengths and weaknesses. Also they have their own usage in real life computer applications. Efficiency of these data structures can be measured by two factors (Time).
</p>
<h2>GRAPHS</h2>
<p>Graphs are awesome data structures that you use every day through Google Search, Google Maps, GPS, and social media.
They are used to represent elements that share connections.
The elements in the graph are called Nodes and the connections between them are called Edges.
Graphs can be directed, when their edges have a specific orientation, similar to one-way streets, or undirected, when their edges don’t have a specific orientation, similar to two-way streets.
Edges can have a value associated with them, called weight.
If a graph has many edges, it’s called a dense graph. Otherwise, if it has few edges, it’s called a sparse graph.
A series of connections can form a cycle if they create a path that let you to return to the sames node</p>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<p>An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
The above image can be looked as a top-level view of a staircase where you are at the base of the staircase. Each element can be uniquely identified by their index in the array (in a similar way as you could identify your friends by the step on which they were on in the above example).</p>
<h2>Linked List</h2>
<p>Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.
1) The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.
<br>2) Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.
For example, in a system, if we maintain a sorted list of IDs in an array id[].<br>
id[] = [1000, 1010, 1050, 2000, 2040].<br>
And if we want to insert a new ID 1005, then to maintain the sorted order, we have to move all the elements after 1000 (excluding 1000).
Deletion is also expensive with arrays until unless some special techniques are used. For example, to delete 1010 in id[], everything after 1010 has to be moved.
<br>
<b>Advantages over arrays</b><br>
1) Dynamic size<br>
2) Ease of insertion/deletion
<br>
<b>Drawbacks:</b><br>
1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. Read about it here.
<br>2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
<br>3) Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked lists.</p>
<h2>Binary Tree</h2>
<p><b>Trees:</b></br> Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures.</br>
<b>Tree Vocabulary:</b></br> The topmost node is called root of the tree. The elements that are directly under an element are called its children. The element directly above something is called its parent. For example, ‘a’ is a child of ‘f’, and ‘f’ is the parent of ‘a’. Finally, elements with no children are called leaves.
<b><br>Why Trees?</b><br>
1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer.
<br>2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays).
<br>3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists).
<br>4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees don’t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.
<br><b>
Main applications of trees include:</b><br>
1. Manipulate hierarchical data.
<br>2. Make information easy to search (see tree traversal).
<br>3. Manipulate sorted lists of data.
<br>4. As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects.
<br>5. Router algorithms
<br>6. Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess).<br>
<b>Binary Tree:</b><br> A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.
<br><b>Binary Tree Representation in C:</b><br> A tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in tree. If the tree is empty, then value of root is NULL.
</p>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.
Declaring a string is as simple as declaring a one dimensional array. Below is the basic syntax for declaring a string in C programming language.
